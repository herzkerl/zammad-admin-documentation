Pushing monitoring notifications via http call
==============================================

Within the integration overview you can find two script examples for host and service notifications. 
Locate these scripts within ``/opt/omd/sites/{SITENAME}/local/share/check_mk/notifications/`` and ensure 
they can be executed.

   .. tip:: As soon as you've saved the required script, go to â€žNotificationsâ€Ÿ â†’ â€žâž• New Ruleâ€Ÿ. 
      You can then select your scripts as â€žNotification Methodâ€Ÿ.

         .. hint:: Our sample scripts do not require further parameters upon calling. ðŸ¤“

If you want to use the Checkmk integration out of the notification scope or maybe for another monitoring 
tool, you can also copy the endpoint URL. This URL is generated during Zammads installation and doesn't 
require further authentication.

Attributes you can use
----------------------

Let's talk about attributes - first of all, the following parameters are the default parameters.

``event_id`` (mandatory)
   Even though Zammad currently doesn't take the event_id in account further, this ID should be unique.

   Checkmk variable ``NOTIFY_SERVICEPROBLEMID`` or ``NOTIFY_HOSTPROBLEMID`` will provide a unique ID per incident.

``host`` (mandatory)
   The e.g. hostname or identifier of the faulty system. 
   Zammad uses this to identify open tickets for this system.

   .. hint:: If the host value is not the same on e.g. recovery calls, Zammad is not able to recognize a follow up.

``service`` (optional)
   If applicable, this is the faulty service. 

   The Checkmk variable ``NOTIFY_SERVICEDESC`` returns the service name.

   .. hint:: Zammad uses service and host together to identify follow ups on existing issue tickets. 
      The service name may not change upon e.g. recovery, if Zammad should recognize the follow up.

   .. note:: If service is not provided, Zammad will provide service like so: ``Service: -``.

``state`` (mandatory)
   The current state of the service or host in question. 
   Zammad does not restrict the possible values here.

   The Checkmk variable ``NOTIFY_SERVICESTATE`` will return: ``OK``, ``WARN``, ``CRIT`` or ``UNKNOWN``.

   .. note:: ``UP`` and ``OK`` are recovering the ticket.

``text`` (optional)
   The output depends on the issue and service. It usually provides error details of the check.

   .. note:: If no text is provided, Zammad will provide it like so: ``Text: -``.

Manipulate ticket attributes
----------------------------

In some cases the default alerting like above isn't enough. In such a case, you can provide further 
post variables that *have to* be valid ticket attributes.

This allows you to fill custom objects or maybe even pre-assign an owner if needed. 
Here's an example of a possible call you could create:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ curl -X POST -F "event_id=1" -F "host=sample-host" -F "state=WARN" -F "text=Some issue..." -F "priority=3 high" https://verification-20200807.zammad.com/api/v1/integration/check_mk/030e4816bec37e5909cca98d6c1beb7c

The above example creates a ticket with priority ``3 high``.
You can find more samples in our :doc:`example section <learn-by-example>`.

.. warning:: Additional attributes can only be used upon ticket creation. If you have an existing issue 
   ticket and try to set further ticket attributes, Zammad will ignore that ticket attribute.
